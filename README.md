# Group-Project-2021-2022: Magic Mario

## Magic Mario will be a platformer with similar mechanics to the Mario games, except for the player's movements. The player will traverse the game by casting spell that will launch the player in an arc. The spells must be cast on the ground in order to prevent flight and there will be limited mana to cast spells, forcing careful deliberation before each jump.
