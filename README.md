# Group-Project-2021-2022: Music Mario

## Music Mario will be a platformer with similar mechanics to the Mario games, except for the player's movements. The player will traverse the game by loud music that will launch the player in an arc. The notes must be played at the ground in order to prevent flight and there will be limited breath to play instruments, forcing careful deliberation before each jump. 

##possibly with the magic of music??
